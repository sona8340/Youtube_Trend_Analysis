Focus on the INDIA dataset

Project Motivation

Through analyzing the YouTube trending videos data, I was aiming to answer these questionsï¼š

- How many views do our trending videos have? Do most of them have a large number of views? Is having a large number of views required for a video to become trending?
- The same questions above, but applied to likes and comment count instead of views.
Which video remained the most on the trendin-videos list?
How many trending videos contain a fully-capitalized word in their titles?
What are the lengths of trending video titles? Is this length related to the video becoming trendy?
How are views, likes, dislikes, comment count, title length, and other attributes correlate with (relate to) each other? How are they connected?
What are the most common words in trending video titles?
Which YouTube channels have the largest number of trending videos?
Which video category (e.g. Entertainment, Gaming, Comedy, etc.) has the largest number of trending videos?
When were trending videos published? On which days of the week? at which times of the day?
